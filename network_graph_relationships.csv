Outside of Mordor, it's all sort of mystical and environmental and nothing works. | There are quite a lot of people who think [a new nation] is not possible. That's a good thing. We don't need to really worry about those people very much, because since they don't think it's possible they won't take us very seriously.

All you need is command of the police. | I've been coaching Peter Thiel… he's fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully. | You're spinning up this new executive branch and the powers of your new executive branch are effectively unlimited. | If you agree with me that democracy is the problem, not the solution, there's nothing wrong with a military coup. | The best alternative to genociding the undesirables is permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. | The deep right is the faction of truth. The deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power. The political goal of the deep right is straightforward: replace the regime. | The hard part is to take control of the streets. How can you fence off a street and make clear that it's under your control? Take total control of your neighborhood, push out all blues. | Convince people the system is irreparable. Ignore the courts, and move fast. Replace everyone. Nationalize the police. Dissolve city and state elections. Shut down media and universities. | The most profitable disposition for dealing with the undesirables is to convert them into biodiesel. Okay, just kidding. …the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder without any of the moral stigma. | Trump himself… will not be the CEO. He will be the chairman of the board—he will select the CEO (an experienced executive). This process, which obviously has to be televised, will be complete by his inauguration—at which the transition to the next regime will start immediately. | As the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spider web of tens, even hundreds of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation, without regard to the resident's opinions."|/public/images/yarvin.jpg

Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning. | Almost one third of the landmass of the United States is owned by the federal government… we should hold a contest to charter 10 new cities and award them to the best new proposals. | Home-growns are next. The home-growns. You gotta build about five more places. [The El Salvador prison] is not big enough."|/public/images/trump.jpg
