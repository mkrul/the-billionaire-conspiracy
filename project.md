# Network Graph Project Plan: Relationship Visualization System

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
Build an interactive network graph visualization system that charts relationships between individuals based on the data provided in `network_graph_relationships.csv`. The graph will visually represent connections, influence relationships, and affiliations between people.

### Key Features
- Interactive network visualization showing connections between individuals
- Node representation for each person with appropriate sizing based on influence
- Edge visualization showing relationship types
- Filtering capabilities by connection type, ventures, or other attributes
- Search functionality to find specific individuals
- Detailed information display when selecting a node
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Dynamic graph generation directly from CSV data, allowing easy updates by modifying the CSV file

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technologies
- **JavaScript Library**: Use Highcharts with its networkgraph module (as seen in sample)
- **HTML/CSS**: Responsive layout with modern styling
- **Data Processing**: JavaScript for CSV parsing and data transformation

### Data Structure
- Nodes: Represent individuals
- Edges: Represent relationships between individuals
- Node Attributes: Name, Influence level, Ventures, Quotes
- Edge Attributes: Relationship type (Friends, Hired, Appointed, etc.)

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Data Processing (Week 1)
- [x] Set up project structure
- [ ] Create a dynamic data parser to transform CSV content into a graph-compatible format at runtime or on-demand.
- [ ] Design basic UI layout
- [ ] Implement initial HTML/CSS framework

### Phase 2: Basic Visualization (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement basic network graph using Highcharts
- [ ] Create node representation for each person
- [ ] Establish connections based on relationship data
- [ ] Apply basic styling to nodes and edges

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visualization & Interaction (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement node sizing based on influence or connection count
- [ ] Add color coding for different relationship types
- [ ] Create hover effects to show basic information
- [ ] Implement zoom and pan functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities (by relationship type, ventures, etc.)
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Create detailed information panel for selected nodes
- [ ] Add ability to highlight specific relationship paths

### Phase 5: Refinement & Launch (Week 5)
- [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on testing
- [ ] Add export/share functionality
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Documentation and deployment

## 4. Data Processing Specifications

### CSV to Graph Data Transformation
1. Parse `network_graph_relationships.csv` dynamically when the visualization is loaded or refreshed.
2. For each person (row) in the CSV:
   - Create a node with attributes derived from the CSV columns (e.g., Name, Influence, Ventures, Quotes).
   - Parse the "Connections" field to establish edges.
   - Parse the "Influence" field and other relevant fields to define relationship types and node properties.

### Data Structure Example
```javascript
{
  nodes: [
    { id: "Peter Thiel", group: 1, ventures: ["SpaceX", "Anduril", ...], quotes: [...] },
    { id: "Curtis Yarvin", group: 2, ventures: ["Urbit"], quotes: [...] },
    // ...
  ],
  links: [
    { source: "Peter Thiel", target: "Palmer Luckey", type: "Friends with" },
    { source: "Peter Thiel", target: "Sam Altman", type: "Friends with" },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## 5. UI/UX Design

### Main Components
1. **Graph Visualization Area**
   - Central area showing the network graph
   - Zoomable and pannable canvas

2. **Control Panel**
   - Filters for relationship types, ventures
   - Search box for finding specific people
   - Display options (node size, layout, etc.)

3. **Information Panel**
   - Shows detailed information about selected node
   - Displays quotes, ventures, and all relationships
   - Option to focus on selected node's connections

### Interaction Design
- Click: Select node and show details
- Hover: Display basic info tooltip
- Drag: Reposition nodes for better visibility
- Scroll/Pinch: Zoom in/out
- Search: Highlight matching nodes

## 6. Testing Strategy

- **Data Integrity Testing**: Ensure all relationships from CSV are correctly represented
- **Performance Testing**: Test with full dataset to ensure smooth interaction
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility with major browsers
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Test on various screen sizes
- **User Testing**: Gather feedback on usability and visualization clarity

## 7. Enhancement Possibilities

- Timeline visualization to show how relationships developed over time
- Community detection to identify clusters of closely related individuals
- Integration with additional data sources for richer information
- Animated transitions between different filtering states
- Advanced analytics on the network structure

## 8. Technical Dependencies

- Highcharts (core library)
- Highcharts networkgraph module
- CSV parsing functionality
- Modern browser with JavaScript enabled

## 9. Deliverables

1. Fully functional network graph visualization
2. Data processing script for CSV transformation
3. Documentation on usage and customization
4. Source code with comments

## 10. Success Criteria

- Successfully visualizes all relationships from the provided CSV
- Provides intuitive navigation and exploration of the network
- Performs efficiently with the complete dataset
- Displays clear and accurate information about each person
- Allows meaningful insights to be drawn from the visualization
- Graph updates dynamically to reflect changes in the `network_graph_relationships.csv` file.
