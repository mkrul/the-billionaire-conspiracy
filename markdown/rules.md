1) ALWAYS carefully read markdown/project_specs.md and markdown/context.md before you propose a change.
2) ALWAYS summarize our changes in markdown/milestones.md after you make a change.
3) NEVER leave code comments.
4) NEVER ask if I would like you to proceed with making changes; just make the change. I trust your judgement.
5) ALWAYS use the current industry standard best practices for the tech stack you're working with.
6) ALWAYS fix linter errors.
