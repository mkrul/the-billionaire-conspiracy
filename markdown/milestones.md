### 2024-03-19 - Cytoscape.js Integration

- Installed Cytoscape.js v3.28.1 and TypeScript types
- Created basic graph container in HTML with proper dimensions
- Implemented initial Cytoscape instance with test graph
- Added error handling for container initialization
- Verified library functionality with test nodes and edges

- Adjusted the CSS for the #venture-legend in index.html to set a fixed width of 300px and remove the max-height constraint to make the panel wider and its size consistent.
- Updated the media query breakpoint for the Ventures panel in index.html from 500px to 600px.
- Reduced the border width for highlighted venture-affiliated nodes in src/styles/network.ts from 18px to 6px.
- Updated the responsive breakpoint in the getResponsiveStyles function in src/components/NetworkGraph/index.ts to 600px.
- Applied fix to ensure red node and edge highlighting is visible on click by including highlighted styles in defaultStyles in src/styles/network.ts.
- Changed the node text color back to white in src/styles/network.ts.
