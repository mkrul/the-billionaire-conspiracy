# Project Summary
Build a lightweight, browser-based influence map (~20 nodes) by feeding a static JSON dataset into Cytoscape.js, the only library that meets all needs—zoom/pan, dark-mode theming, smooth CSS-style animations, click-to-isolate focus, hover tooltips/modals, and optional filters—without requiring React. The plan: integrate Cytoscape, load & map the JSON to graph elements, render with a force layout, then layer on interactions (node highlight/reset, tooltips, detail modals), add light/dark themes via style switching, and ship optional niceties like search, pulse effects, and category filters. Wrap the code in a self-contained module, ensure responsive resizing, cross-browser testing, and document how to update the JSON so the visualization can grow painlessly down the line.

## Epic: **Setup & Configuration**

*Milestone Goal:* Establish the development environment and include all necessary libraries, ensuring a solid foundation for the visualization project.

- **Initialize Project Repository & Environment**

    *Description:* Set up the project repository (e.g., initialize Git and `package.json`) and configure the development environment. Install Node.js and any necessary build tools or frameworks. Ensure the project runs locally (for example, via a simple HTTP server or dev server).

    *Input:* None (fresh project setup).

    *Output:* A basic project scaffold with version control and build tooling configured.

    *Plan Reference:* Initial setup and environment configuration section of the plan.
