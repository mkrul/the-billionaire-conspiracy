# Project Summary

Build a lightweight, browser-based influence map (~20 nodes) by feeding a static JSON dataset into Cytoscape.js, the only library that meets all needs—zoom/pan, dark-mode theming, smooth CSS-style animations, click-to-isolate focus, hover tooltips/modals, and optional filters—without requiring React. The plan: integrate Cytoscape, load & map the JSON to graph elements, render with a force layout, then layer on interactions (node highlight/reset, tooltips, detail modals), add light/dark themes via style switching, and ship optional niceties like search, pulse effects, and category filters. Wrap the code in a self-contained module, ensure responsive resizing, cross-browser testing, and document how to update the JSON so the visualization can grow painlessly down the line.

## Epic: **Setup & Configuration**

_Milestone Goal:_ Establish the development environment and include all necessary libraries, ensuring a solid foundation for the visualization project.

- **Create Base HTML and Graph Container**

  _Description:_ Set up the HTML structure or main application component that will host the network graph. For example, add a `<div id="cy">` element (or equivalent) that Cytoscape will render the network into. If using a framework (React/Vue), create a component with a container for the Cytoscape canvas.

  _Input:_ N/A (project files from initialization).

  _Output:_ A visible empty container on the page (e.g., a blank div) prepared for Cytoscape to use.

  _Plan Reference:_ Plan section on UI layout/setup.
