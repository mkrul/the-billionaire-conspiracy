# Project Summary

Build a lightweight, browser-based influence map (~20 nodes) by feeding a static JSON dataset into Cytoscape.js, the only library that meets all needs—zoom/pan, dark-mode theming, smooth CSS-style animations, click-to-isolate focus, hover tooltips/modals, and optional filters—without requiring React. The plan: integrate Cytoscape, load & map the JSON to graph elements, render with a force layout, then layer on interactions (node highlight/reset, tooltips, detail modals), add light/dark themes via style switching, and ship optional niceties like search, pulse effects, and category filters. Wrap the code in a self-contained module, ensure responsive resizing, cross-browser testing, and document how to update the JSON so the visualization can grow painlessly down the line.

## Epic: **Data Handling & Network Rendering**

_Milestone Goal:_ Load or define the influence data and visualize it as an interactive network using Cytoscape.js with basic styling.

- **Initialize Cytoscape Graph with Data**

  _Description:_ Use Cytoscape.js to create the network visualization with the prepared elements. Call `cytoscape()` with the container, elements array, a layout, and basic style options. Choose an initial layout algorithm (e.g., `cose` for force-directed layout or a hierarchical layout if the influence data is directional). Ensure all nodes and edges from the dataset are rendered.

  _Input:_ Cytoscape container element and elements array (from previous tasks).

  _Output:_ The influence map graph appears on screen with all nodes and edges in a reasonable initial layout.

  _Plan Reference:_ Core network rendering section of the plan.
