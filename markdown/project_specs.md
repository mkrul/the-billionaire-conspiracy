# Project Summary

Build a lightweight, browser-based influence map (~20 nodes) by feeding a static JSON dataset into Cytoscape.js, the only library that meets all needs—zoom/pan, dark-mode theming, smooth CSS-style animations, click-to-isolate focus, hover tooltips/modals, and optional filters—without requiring React. The plan: integrate Cytoscape, load & map the JSON to graph elements, render with a force layout, then layer on interactions (node highlight/reset, tooltips, detail modals), add light/dark themes via style switching, and ship optional niceties like search, pulse effects, and category filters. Wrap the code in a self-contained module, ensure responsive resizing, cross-browser testing, and document how to update the JSON so the visualization can grow painlessly down the line.

## Epic: **Setup & Configuration**

_Milestone Goal:_ Establish the development environment and include all necessary libraries, ensuring a solid foundation for the visualization project.

- **Render Sample Graph for Verification**

  _Description:_ Write a small test script to instantiate a Cytoscape graph with a **very simple** dataset (e.g., two nodes and one edge). This is to confirm that Cytoscape renders properly in the container. Use a basic layout (default) and minimal style. Verify that the sample nodes and edge appear on screen.

  _Input:_ Hardcoded sample graph data (tiny nodes/edges array).

  _Output:_ A minimal network graph displayed in the app (for example, two labeled nodes connected by an edge, visible in the browser).

  _Plan Reference:_ End of setup phase (verification step in project plan).
